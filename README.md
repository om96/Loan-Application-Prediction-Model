# Loan-Application-Prediction-Model

This is a project I completed for my Data Mining in R course (BUAN 6356) with my group members: Trevor Baum, Shresth Abrol, and Jay Kim.

The project analyzes various factors from property loan applications to create models which identify if a future application should be approved for a loan.

## Executive Summary

This report will detail the findings of four MS Business Analytics candidates at The University of Texas at Dallas. Four predictive methods are used (Decision Trees & Random Forest, Logit, Neural Network and various combinations of the three) to create several business intelligence models that predict whether a loan applicant will be approved by the bank or not based on attributes compiled in the loan application. The combination of these attributes is the basis of the business intelligence models. We can find which attributes are most important to the approval of a business model which lead to key managerial implications and translate to real world business benefit. 
Our goal was to create a model that would be useful in the automation of the loan application decision process and create value for loan issuing banks and the managers that work at these banks.
